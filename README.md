# 🐱 Cat Classifier using Perceptron

This project demonstrates a simple binary image classifier that distinguishes between **cat** and **non-cat** images using a classic **Perceptron** implemented with **NumPy**. The goal is to show how a basic neural network can be trained from scratch without deep learning libraries.

## 🧠 About the Project

- **Task**: Binary classification (Cat 🐱 vs Non-Cat 🚫)
- **Model**: Perceptron (Single-layer neural network)
- **Frameworks**: NumPy, Matplotlib, h5py, PIL
- **Dataset**: Preprocessed `.h5` datasets and custom test images

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustRusslan/cat-classifier-perceptron.git
cd cat-classifier-perceptron
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries:
pip install numpy matplotlib h5py pillow

### 3. Launch the notebook
Open cat-classifier-perceptron.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode and run all the cells.

🧪 How to Test Your Own Images
Add your image(s) to the test_cat_noncat/ folder

Make sure filenames match the naming used in the notebook (myimg0.jpg, myimg1.jpg, etc.)

Run the last section of the notebook: Test on your own data
